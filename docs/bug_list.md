# Bug List

Defects found and not yet fixed, and defects fixed recently enough to be worth remembering.

**Why this file exists.** The metrics-inside-CPU-pinning defect below was found on 2026-08-04,
judged not worth fixing at that moment, and then forgotten — it survived only in a working note
nobody else could see, and had to be rediscovered on 2026-08-08 before anything was done about it.
A defect that is known and invisible is worse than one nobody has found: the project carries the
risk without carrying the knowledge.

**Every entry records the date it was found and how it was found.** The second is the more useful
half. "Found by the trading-day load run" tells you which activity is worth repeating; "found by
reading the code" tells you the tests would not have caught it.

Fixed entries are kept for one release cycle and then deleted — the commit is the permanent record.

### Environment placeholders are missing outside dev

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-07 (exact date not recorded) |
| How | Reading `deploy.py` against the environment files while working on config templating |
| Impact | `deploy.py` exits on preprod, prod and test-1 |

`environments/preprod.toml`, `prod.toml` and `test-1.toml` each lack 10–12 of the placeholder
values their component templates require. Only `dev.toml` is complete, so only dev can be deployed.

**Deliberately not fixed**: the missing values are real hostnames, ports and certificate paths for
environments that do not exist yet. Inventing them would produce a file that deploys and then
fails at run time, which is worse than one that refuses to deploy.

### A growing hash map stalls the reactor callback thread for over a second

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-08-08 |
| How | The first clean compressed-trading-day load run — the reactor's own watchdog logged it, and the profile confirmed the cause |
| Impact | p99 of 733 ms at 4.2M orders, over 1 s at 8.4M, after which the pipeline did not recover and 1,167,392 of 9,556,000 orders were never accepted |

The matching engine's order book is a `tsl::robin_map` with `power_of_two_growth_policy<2ul>`. It
doubles, and each doubling rehashes the whole table **on the callback thread**. Stalls land only on
exact powers of two — all five stalls of 200 ms or more did, and none occurred elsewhere.

**This is a framework requirement, not an application bug.** Calling `reserve()` in the matching
engine would remove the symptom from a stub and teach nothing. `pubsub_itc_fw` offers slab and pool
allocators for messages *in flight* and nothing at all for long-lived hot-path state that *grows* —
so every application that keeps state (an order book, a session table, a subscription registry)
will grow a container on a reactor callback thread and eventually stall it.

See [Compressed Trading Day Load Profile](design/trading_day_load.md).

### The venue accepts orders indefinitely with no matching engine, and tells nobody

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-08-08 |
| How | The first clean trading-day load run, after the matching engine was OOM-killed |
| Impact | 924,000 orders accepted and acknowledged to the member with nothing able to process them; 1,087,912 orders deferred over 7 minutes |

When the matching engine connection drops, the sequencer commits each order to the WAL and
defers forwarding it:

```
SequencerThread: no matching engine connected -- order seq=59678842 WAL-committed,
forward deferred until an ME reconnects (recovered via WAL replay on ME promotion)
```

That policy is sound for a brief failover — the orders are durable and a promoted ME
replays them. Three things about it are not.

**The assumption can stop holding, and nothing notices.** An ME was promoted and did
reconcile, then died two minutes later. The sequencer went on deferring for another five
minutes, waiting for a recovery that could no longer happen because no matching engine
existed at all.

**It is logged at INFO, once per order — 1,087,912 times.** A million lines saying the
venue is degraded, at the level used for routine progress. Volume that large hides the
condition rather than reporting it.

**Nothing propagates to the gateway.** The sequencer knew there was no matching engine for
seven minutes. The gateway kept accepting orders and acknowledging them, logging
`dropped=0` throughout, and the member saw no difference. The sequencer has the knowledge,
the gateway has the member relationship, and there is no path between them.

Suggested shape, not yet designed: deferring a handful of orders across a brief failover
should stay silent; deferring thousands over minutes should escalate — a rate-limited
WARNING, a metric for deferred-order count and age, and ultimately a signal that makes the
gateways stop accepting. **A venue that takes orders it cannot process is worse than one
that refuses them.**

Related: the HA entry below, since the deferral policy assumes a promotion that will
succeed.

### HA fails over into a condition both nodes share

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-08-08 |
| How | The first clean trading-day load run — the primary matching engine was OOM-killed and the promoted secondary died 2 minutes later |
| Impact | Failover postponed an outage by about 4 minutes instead of preventing it |

The HA mechanism itself performed correctly and quickly:

```
16:49:30  primary OOM-killed (9.9 GB, book 8,388,608)
16:49:31  secondary: replication connection lost -- replica book now stale
16:49:46  promotion timeout fired, arbitration requested, elected leader
16:49:49  reconciled 58,444 records in 2.8s -- book 8,445,780
16:51:41  reactor watchdog: callback stuck [109105 ms] -- orderly shutdown
```

Detection, arbitration, promotion and reconciliation all worked. **The secondary then died
of the same thing**, because it came up holding a book of 8,445,780 orders on a machine
that had just killed a process for holding 9.9 GB.

**HA protects against independent failures. It cannot protect against a systemic condition
both nodes share** — memory exhaustion, a poison message, a bug reached by the same input,
a shared dependency. Failing over into it converts an outage into a slightly later outage
and burns the standby doing it.

Worth designing for explicitly. Open questions rather than a plan:

- Should a promoted node **check its own headroom** before accepting promotion, and decline
  if it is in the same state the primary died in?
- Should the arbiter know *why* the primary went, so it can distinguish "the process died"
  from "the process died of something I am also suffering"?
- Is there a signal a node can publish that means "I am not a safe failover target"?
- What is the right behaviour when there is no safe target — refuse orders rather than
  accept ones that cannot be processed? See the entry above about accepting orders with no
  matching engine.

Note this run's book growth was itself an artefact: the ME does no matching and the load
client cannot yet cancel, so nothing removed orders. The **failover behaviour** is the
finding here, not the growth.

### `cmake --install` re-lays config templates unexpanded

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-08-08 |
| How | A trading-day run failed to start immediately after a rebuild |
| Impact | `devenv.py` refuses to start until `deploy.py` is re-run |

Every build re-installs the `${placeholder}` templates over the deployed, expanded configs, so
**`deploy.py` must be re-run after every build**. `devenv.py` does detect it and says so clearly,
which is why this is a trap rather than a fault — but it is easy to hit when iterating on a
component and then starting the venue.

### Shutdown timeout errors in timer tests

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | before 2026-07 (carried over from the roadmap's Known Issues) |
| How | Timer test logs |
| Impact | Unknown — the errors appear but nothing is known to misbehave |

After the timer SEGV fix, "did not stop within shutdown_timeout" and "failed to join within
shutdown_timeout" still appear in timer test logs. **Root cause not identified.** Worth noting that
`ThreadWithJoinTimeout` exists precisely because a raw `std::thread` terminates on an early return
before join, so a join that times out is not obviously benign.

### OGT `process_message` exit paths not audited

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | before 2026-07 (carried over from the roadmap's Known Issues) |
| How | Code reading |
| Impact | Possible false stuck-thread detection |

If any exit path from `process_message` skips updating `time_event_finished_`, the watchdog would
report a thread as stuck when it is not. Not yet audited. Given that the reactor watchdog is what
made the rehash stall diagnosable, false positives from it would be costly.

### Doxygen 1.8.14 turns `\ref` labels into bare directory links

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-07 (exact date not recorded) |
| How | Building the docs on RHEL8, where 1.8.14 is the newest packaged release |
| Impact | Documentation only; the architecture map's cross-links break |

An unresolved `\ref` collapses to `href="../../"`, which a browser opens as a directory listing —
or, on Windows, a file chooser. 1.8.14 does **not** fail the build on an unresolved reference, so
this is silent. `docs/architecture_map_howto.dox` proposes a post-build check; not written.

### ResendRequest under load

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | before 2026-08 (carried over from the roadmap's Known Issues) |
| How | Noted when the feature was written |
| Impact | Unknown |

Partly overtaken by the 0.3.0 work, which replaced the blanket `SequenceReset-GapFill` with real
resends carrying `PossDupFlag`. The original concern — never exercised under load — still stands,
and the trading-day profile is a natural place to exercise it once it drives the FIX gateway.

### fix-test-client reports a dead gateway poorly

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-07 (exact date not recorded) |
| How | Manual testing of the logon page |
| Impact | The UI misleads about connection state |

Two undecided items: `lastError` is left empty, and `connected` stays true after the gateway dies.
FIX produces no disconnect message, so there is nothing to display without inferring it.

## Fixed

### Metrics silently disabled when CPU pinning is off

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-08-04 |
| How | Reading the configuration loaders while adding the Prometheus metrics |
| Fixed | 2026-08-08 |

`config.metrics_configuration = MetricsConfigurationLoader::load(toml)` sat **inside** the
`if (config.cpu_pinning_enabled)` block in the matching engine and both gateway loaders. A
component with pinning turned off exposed no metrics at all — no error, no warning, just an
endpoint that never appeared.

Left alone when first found because nothing depended on it. It became urgent when the test
harnesses moved their ground truth onto those counters, at which point a silent disable would make
them pass while verifying nothing. **This is exactly the defect that motivated this file.**

### Orphaned build directories break coverage capture

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-08-08 |
| How | Every incremental coverage build was failing; the error named standard-library headers and pointed nowhere near the cause |
| Fixed | `10f4578` |

`applications/binary_gateway/` was renamed on 2026-08-01 and CMake never removed the old target
tree. gcovr searches the whole build tree *before* the report-level excludes apply, found `.gcno`
files with no `.gcda`, could not resolve their compilation directory, searched upward and aborted
at `/`.

### Trading-day phases reused ClOrdIDs

| | |
|---|---|
| Found | 2026-08-08 |
| How | The first trading-day run; `perf_run.py`'s own loss accounting reported the mismatch |
| Fixed | `d47112e` |

The phase scheduler restarts the load client per phase and every invocation numbered its orders
from 1, so 5,256,000 of 8,632,000 orders were rejected as duplicates and four of seven phases
recorded no latency at all. Quiet in the worst way: rejected orders still travel through the
gateway and sequencer, so the load looked real while measuring nothing.
